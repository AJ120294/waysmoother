- **Customizable Travel Dates and Times**: Enables travel planning for future dates.
- **Map Visualization**: Integrated Google Maps for interactive route visualization.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (for API endpoints)
- **Map Integration**: Google Maps API
- **Styling**: CSS, Bootstrap
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Task Management**: Trello
- **Documentation**: LaTeX for project and technical documentation
